Had some fun with [Ember.js][ember] and [Firebase][firebase] today. Tried out the [EmberFire][emberfire] lib provided by Firebase to use Firebase with Ember-Data. I also used the [Ember CLI][cli] for the first time, can really recommend it. Wanted to see how easy it would be to build an *real time syncing Ember.js app* and then deploy it to the new and easy to use *Firebase hosting* service.

It resulted in a [simple planning poker app][app] to help with the sprint planning for my remote team. I've uploaded the [source to Github][git].
