I went to 24 Hour Business Camp with [Ingemar](http://twitter.com/ingmr) and [Jonny](http://twitter.com/javve) (both colleagues from [Mynewsdesk](http://www.mynewsdesk.com)) on October the 30th last year. It took place at the awesome japanese spa [Yasuragi](http://www.yasuragi.se). We spent the 24h coding on our project [SilarApp](http://silarapp.com), a *clean and ambient real time data visualization dashboard*. I think we did it quite well, we even won the [jury's award](http://www.internetdagarna.se/nyheter/juryns-favoriter-fran-24hbc-pa-besok). Now we're working hard on our spare time to release the first public version of SilarApp (it's currently in closed beta) and we're really proud of what we have done so far.
