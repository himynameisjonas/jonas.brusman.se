Thought I might be able to shoot a bit more again and get inspiration for some nice pictures when I was in Dublin for a couple of weekends ago. But i was a little bit disappointed when i transferred the photographs to my computer. Anyway, here is a photo of Eva on a shopping street in the middle of Dublin.
