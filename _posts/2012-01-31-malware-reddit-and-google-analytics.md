This is what happens with your traffic when one of your sites gets infected by malware and therefor being "blocked" by google. From a daily count of 200-300 visitors down to 0-2 visitors per day. But it's a funny graph to look at.

And this is the awesome thing that happens when one of the posts of the same site as above is posted and gets popular on [reddit](http://reddit.com). From a stable 150-200 visitors per to a huge peak at 20 000. Such a big difference that the rest of the days looks all flat.
