Use [Prose](http://prose.io/), *a content editor for GitHub, optimized for managing websites*, to get a web based interface for managing your Jekyll site (or other text-based content in your Github repositories). You can now write a new blog post or fix that typo *without even leaving the browser*. You can even specify [metadata defaults](http://prose.io/help/handbook.html#metadata_defaults) for your posts.

This work really out of the box if you host your site on Github via [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/) but if you, like me, are using Heroku you need to set up some more automation. See my previous post on how to *[automatically deploy to Heroku when pushing to Github](/2012/07/29/deploy-to-heroku-from-github)*.
