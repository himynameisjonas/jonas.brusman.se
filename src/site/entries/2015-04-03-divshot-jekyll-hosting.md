I used to [host this site on Heroku][heroku-post] but have now moved to a platform build for static sites, or as [Divshot][divshot] puts it: _Static Web Hosting for Developers_. Setting up the site on Divshot was a breeze, took just a couple of seconds from when I started reading [the documentation][docs] to when I had the site up and running. And they even have [a free plan for small sites][pricing] like this one.

### Continious deployment with CircleCI

My previous setup allowed me to just push my updates to the Github repository and have Heroku pull the changes and update the site automatically. The new setup uses [CircleCI][circleci] to accomplish the same. Add your Divshot token to the environment variables on CircleCi ([more info][docs2]) and then tell it to deploy on successful deploy by adding this to the `circle.yml` file in the root of the repository:

```yaml
test:
  override:
    - bundle exec jekyll build
deployment:
  production:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - npm install -g divshot-cli
      - divshot push production —token $DIVSHOT_TOKEN
  staging:
    branch: /(^(?!master$).*$)/
    commands:
      - npm install -g divshot-cli
      - divshot push staging —token $DIVSHOT_TOKEN
```

It will deploy the _master branch to the production_ environment and _all other branches to the staging_ environment. All automatically when pushing to Github.
