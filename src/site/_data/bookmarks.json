    "excerpt": "Since its release last year, how to filter the photos in our shared library to only show the photos I contributed has eluded me. Individual photo metadata shows who contributed a photo (and in the case of duplicates, multiple people might have contributed the same photo), but there was no way to view one’s contributions in bulk.\n\nAfter a few months of latent frustration, I figured out a way!\n\nIn the search bar, enter the e-mail address of the contributor's Apple ID and you should see a auto-suggestion like &quot;👥 Shared by person@example.",
