excerpt: One of my favourite things to do in my free time is to tinker with this
  website. Indeed, this website is the culmination of years of tinkering. I have
  added features like coffee shop maps that I can share with friends, a way for
  me to share my bio in two languages, a sitemap.xml file to help search engines
  find pages on my website, and more.
