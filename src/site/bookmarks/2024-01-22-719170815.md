  Since its release last year, how to filter the photos in our shared library to
  only show the photos I contributed has eluded me. Individual photo metadata
  shows who contributed a photo (and in the case of duplicates, multiple people
  might have contributed the same photo), but there was no way to view oneâ€™s
  contributions in bulk.


  After a few months of latent frustration, I figured out a way!


  In the search bar, enter the e-mail address of the contributor's Apple ID and you should see a auto-suggestion like &quot;ðŸ‘¥ Shared by person@example.
