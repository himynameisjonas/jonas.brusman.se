I got, *as usual*, bored with the previous design of this site, so I decided to change it. This is something that happens from time to time and it gives me the chance to experiment with new things.

## Some ~~more or~~ less notable changes
* New colors which I found on [@randomColorContrasts@botsin.space](https://tacocat.space/@randomColorContrasts@botsin.space).
* Trying out [Open Heart Protocol](https://openheart.fyi/) buttons on each post, a tiny heart button to show appreciation for the post. Found out about it from [benji](https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/).
* Removed [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and replaced it with two new fonts:
  * Added [Tropi Land](https://www.fontspace.com/tropi-land-font-f101440) as the custom font for the "logo" to give it a more playful look.
  * Added [Overpass](https://overpassfont.org/) as the main font for the site.
  * Used [Glyphhanger]() to subset the fonts to only the characters used on the site. Overpass went from 310.95 KB to 31.98 KB and Tropi Land from 77.11 KB to 6.42 KB.
* Renamed Notes to [Articles](/articles/), not sure if that will stick but notes sounded too much like short posts. Maybe it will come back, but as a syndication of the notes I post on [Mastodon](https://tacocat.space/@jonas).
* Sprinkled some [icons from Heroicons](http://heroicons.com) to the main elements/navigation.
* Replaced [Instantpage](https://instant.page) with [Quicklink](https://getquick.link) for prefetching links.
* Setup [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for js bundling with [eleventy-plugin-vite](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-vite).
