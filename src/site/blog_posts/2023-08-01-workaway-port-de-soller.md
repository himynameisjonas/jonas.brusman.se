Port de Sóller, Mallorca, Spain, May 15-17 2023.

My workplace, [Teamtailor](https://teamtailor.com), has a concept called "Workaway," where 4-10 of us, from different offices, go on a trip for a couple of days to get together and work in person. This time we went to Mallorca and stayed in a house in Port de Sóller. We had a great time and got a lot of work done. We also had a lot of fun, ate good food, and enjoyed the sun and the pool.
