I got, *as usual*, bored with the previous design of this site, so I decided to change it. This is something that happens from time to time and it gives me the chance to experiment with new things.

## Some ~~more or~~ less notable changes
* New colors which I found on [@randomColorContrasts@botsin.space](https://tacocat.space/@randomColorContrasts@botsin.space).
* Trying out [Open Heart Protocol](https://openheart.fyi/) buttons on each post, a tiny heart button to show appreciation for the post. Found out about it from [benji](https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/).
* Replaced [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) with system fonts so that I could use another custom font for the headings instead.
* Added [Tropi Land](https://www.fontspace.com/tropi-land-font-f101440) as the custom font for the headings to give it a more playful look.
* Renamed Notes to [Texts](/texts/), not sure if that will stick but notes sounded too much like short posts. Maybe it will come back, but as a syndication of the notes I post on [Mastodon](https://tacocat.space/@jonas).
* Sprinkled some [icons from Heroicons](http://heroicons.com) to the main elements/navigation.
* Replaced [Instantpage](https://instant.page) with [Quicklink](https://getquick.link) for prefetching links.
