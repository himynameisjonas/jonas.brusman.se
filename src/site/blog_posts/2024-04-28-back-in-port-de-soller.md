Went back to Port de Sóller for [another workaway trip](/workaway-port-de-soller/). We tried to find a different place to stay but ended up at the same place as last time. It's a nice house, so we're not complaining. As last time, we had a great time, got a lot of work done, cooked good food, and enjoyed, as seen in one of the pictures, a lot of Jamón ibérico.
