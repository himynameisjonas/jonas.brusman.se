You might have noticed in [my last post](my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/) that I am using [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/) as my email service provider. Back in June, I changed my domains DNS to point to Migadu instead of Fastmail has been as worry-free as Fastmail, just cheaper. The main domain I use is based on my wife's family name, and we've got a few folks who would love to have their own *firstname\@lastname* email addresses. Unfortunately, it became quite costly with my previous provider, Fastmail. So, I began exploring other options.

## The big win

That's when I found Migadu. They have a different billing approach that works better for families like mine. Instead of charging for the number of email addresses or accounts, Migaduâ€™s pricing depends on the volume of emails sent and received. This means I can create as many accounts, addresses, or aliases as we want without worrying about the cost.

## The missing stuff

Migadu doesn't offer calendar or contact syncing, but I solved this by moving these functions to Apple iCloud, which is fine since I'm already in the Apple ecosystem.
