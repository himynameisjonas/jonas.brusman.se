I recently merged a Pull Request to enable Jemalloc in our (Teamtailor's) production Rails app, and the results were impressive.

After deploying Jemalloc, our app's memory usage decreased from around 6 GB to just 2.5 GB. Super nice!

Our next step involved switching to ARM architecture with AWS Graviton for our ECS tasks, resulting in improved performance at a lower cost. Two big wins in a short time!
