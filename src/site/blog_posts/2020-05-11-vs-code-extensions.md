Why not blog about some VS Code extensions I'm using, maybe it can inspire someone. I tried to focus on the more unique and fun ones.

#### [TabNine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode)

Mindblowing autocompletion for all languages. It uses machine learning to predict what you're typing, and it's correct almost every time.

#### [Unstable Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable)

A must-have when working with Ember.js, which I do for a living at [Teamtailor](https://www.teamtailor.com).

#### [change-case](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.change-case)

Quickly toggle between camelCase and snake\_case. Or between over ten other cases.

#### [Transformer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dakara.transformer)

I use the *unique lines* feature quite often.

#### [vscode-run-rspec-file](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Thadeu.vscode-run-rspec-file)

Quickly run a single rspec file or even a single rspec line from within VS Code.
