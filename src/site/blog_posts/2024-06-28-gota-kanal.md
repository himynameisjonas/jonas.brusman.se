The traditional bicycle trip along the picturesque Göta Canal to my mom's place for a family picnic takes place every year on the Sunday after Midsummer.

Nora was riding in a child seat on my bike and screamed the whole time. She really doesn't like wind in her face, and we had a headwind the entire way there.
