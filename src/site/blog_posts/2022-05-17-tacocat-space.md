Decided that it was time to try [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) again and after reading [Run your own social](https://runyourown.social) I knew just had to setup my own instance of the [Hometown-fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown).

After spending a couple of hours to find a new domain for the Mastodon server I finally found one that was available and that I liked: meet **[tacocat.space](https://tacocat.space)**.

Feel free to follow me on Mastodon at [@jonas@tacocat.space](https://tacocat.space/@jonas)!
