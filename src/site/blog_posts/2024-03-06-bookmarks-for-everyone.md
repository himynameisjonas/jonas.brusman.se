I have added a new page to this site: [Bookmarks](/bookmarks), where I will share links I find interesting or good. You can subscribe to it with its [new RSS feed](/bookmarks/rss.xml).

I suppose it will include links related to my interests, such as web development, programming in general, photography, the IndieWeb, and other random things.
