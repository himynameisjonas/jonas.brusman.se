*I thought the fix was so weird that I decided to write a blog post about it.*

Have you ever wondered why the electric door on the passenger side of the Volkswagen Sharan won't open after you've fitted a new battery? Neither had I until last week when I picked up my car from the mechanic and noticed that the door button was blinking, and nothing happened when I pressed it. The closing mechanism was working fine after I, with quite some force, opened the door manually.

I asked the shop for help, but they were clueless and tried to diagnose the issue by connecting their iPad to the car's diagnostic port and running a series of tests with no luck. While they did that, I decided to do a quick search online and found a potential solution on [a forum](https://www.volkswagenforum.co.uk/posts/163876/). The solution is to reset the automatic window setup on the door that won't open.

### The solution
1. Using the window button on the door that won't open, open the window fully.
2. Release the button and press it again for 3 seconds.
3. Close the window fully.
4. Release the button and press it again for 3 seconds.

I did this once, and the blinking stopped, and the door opened when I pressed the door button. It was a **weird** fix, but it worked!
